# GitHub Explorer - Full Stack Application

Welcome to **my Github explorer**, a full-stack web application that combines cutting-edge technologies to provide seamless authentication and interaction with GitHub's platform. Designed with performance, scalability, and user experience in mind, this project will leave you impressed by its robust implementation.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

Experience the live application here: [GitHub Explorer](https://lafsha-github-explorer.onrender.com)

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**:

  - GitHub OAuth authentication using `passport-github2`.
  - Secure sessions with `express-session` and environment-based configuration.
  - Protected routes ensuring secure access to user-specific features.

- **Full-Stack Architecture**:

  - **Backend**:
    - Built with `Express.js` for a powerful and modular API structure.
    - MongoDB integration using `mongoose` for dynamic and scalable data storage.
    - Environment variables managed with `dotenv` for security and flexibility.
  - **Frontend**:
    - Developed with `React` for a modern, dynamic, and responsive UI.
    - **React Router DOM** for seamless navigation and protected routing.
    - Stunning UI styled with `Tailwind CSS` and interactive elements with `React Icons`.
    - Notifications and feedback powered by `react-hot-toast`.

- **Dev-Friendly Setup**:

  - Live reloading using `nodemon` for backend development.
  - Frontend development powered by `Vite` for ultra-fast builds and hot module replacement.
  - Code quality ensured with `ESLint` and industry-standard plugins.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

### Backend:

- Node.js (Express.js)
- Passport.js for GitHub OAuth
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- `cors` for handling cross-origin requests
- `dotenv` for secure environment configuration

### Frontend:

- React 18
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite (for build and development)
- React Router DOM
- React Hot Toast for user notifications
- React Icons for enhanced UI

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Clone the repository and follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build and deploy the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## âš¡ Why This Project Stands Out

1. **Secure Authentication**: Implementing OAuth with `passport-github2` ensures seamless and secure login functionality.
2. **Real-Time User Feedback**: Utilizing `react-hot-toast` for instant and engaging notifications.
3. **Modern UI/UX**: Responsive design powered by `Tailwind CSS` and enriched by `React Icons`.
4. **Scalable Backend**: MongoDB integration using `mongoose` enables dynamic data handling.
5. **High Performance**: Built with Vite for blazing-fast development and build processes.
6. **Developer Friendly**: Linting with ESLint ensures clean, maintainable code.
